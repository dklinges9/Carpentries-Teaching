* Starting with Data - Feedback


Content +
* Really liked how you added the comment in and ask the audience what would happen if you just "read" in the CSV
* Good idea to recap what you've just done+1
* Talking through what you are copying and pasting is great, then no one gets lost as to where the statement came from! 

Content -
* "Flat file" may be an unfamiliar term to some
* Consistency with the commenting, just like you added comment on download, add it on the read command as well =)
* Nice to show different ways of opening new file, but didn't say what the difference was between the two ways.
* During recap, type out recap items
Presentation +
* Great job zooming in and out when necessary +1
* I liked the move to ask for a guess from the audience +3
* Great formative assesment and recap, i felt like I had actually done the previous work!

2.Jim Brown, Rutgers University-Camden, jim.brown@rutgers.edu, Lesson: UNIX Shell
* Finding things- Feedback


Content +
* Nice clean terminal that is accessible for most anyone
* Clear and easy to read
* Clear descriptions of what every command did, even if they were previously covered!
* The examples build well on each other, a good "faded" example
* Felt like you covered a lot in 5 minutes, in a good way!

Content -
* try to recap some of the commands and maybe slow down to make sure users are going along wiht you
* Perhaps define "grep", so it's easier for learners to remember its functionality

Presentation +
* Pace is good, a nice balance between talking and coding+2
*  there was a quick mistake with the lower case t, but didn't disrupt flow. Good to show that everyone makes typos +1
* I like that you pulled up the man page for grep

Presentation -
Terminal size was small (hard to realize this while screen sharing though)
Agree with terminal size. Could full-screen and this would make desktop less distracting
* Might pause and run "pwd" after moving directories for beginners +1+1
* New concepts were introduced really fast - would be useful to pause after each new command/flag/etc., show more examples, etc.


3. Lindsey Fox, Vanderbilt University, Office of Research, lindsey.fox@vanderbilt.edu |  Version Control With Git
* Creating a repository

Content +
* Moved at a good pace, explaining git well to someone who doesn't know it already.
* Good explanation of what git status tells you +1
* Good explanation of how git init works and that it's only necessary to run once (could tie into what it does, so they would have an intuition as to why it only needs done once)
Content -
* Could talk about what an initialization means, since these learners likely have never done this before. 
* I imagine this would be mentioned earlier in workshop...but directory might be jargon for some
At the beginning you went through a bunch of commands that didn't do what you wanted - but didn't explain what was happening.

Presentation +
* You dealt with the "error" really well! Sense of humor is important.+2
good that you encouraged learners to speak up if they have issues (problem issues, not GitHub issues)
ending segment by asking a q
Good to let people know they can ask for help
* Asked good questions
* You made a mistake, which is OK. "Live explaining" your thought process  a little more post-mistake is good...but when you found what the problem was, you didn't brush it under the carpet but acknowledged what is was and why a problem

Presentation -
Terminal display could be bigger
I imagine we all use a dark theme....but for non-coders dark themes might look scary! Plus light themes typically easier to see on a projector
A fair number of um's, but not too big of a deal

4. Will French, Vanderbilt Univeresity, Advanced Computing Center, william.r.french@vanderbilt.edu | The Unix Shell
* Pipes and Filters

Content +
did a good kob of recapping commands and doing some formative assesment
Explicitly stated what the command abbreviations stand for! 
included multiple quick, leading, q's...and received great answers from the learners!


Content -

Presentation +
* love the personal connection to the content
* Great job on keeping it clear and visible 
* Good idea to start with your own enthusiasm about why we do this. +1
* full screen, yup
* good to explain what "wc" stands for, and even though you mentioned once, you didnt' assume everyone immediately learned. You mentioned quickly the 2nd time you typed it, a good reminder
* Explaining what each of the files meant (in chemical terms) made the content more interesting
* Great intro to the section, your enthusiasm for pipes was apparent

Presentation -
* at the very beginning you used the "clear" command or something similar to clear your screen, and you might have used that as a moment to remind people of that command.
* Rushed firs few seconds and settled well into a pace
* Rushed through what you were doing when you unzipped the file
* A brief description of what a .pdb file is wouldn't leave people wondering.
* At the beginning, you were typing a little fast...but slowed down as you went


5. Allison Theobold, Montana State University, Data Analysis and Visualization in R (Data Carpentry for Ecologists)
Aggregating and analyzing data with dplyr

Content +
* great explanations of functions, etc while you're using them
* Good explanation of various commands do
* I like the command explanations, very celar
* the written content of the lesson didn't acknowledge the console read out from read_csv, and I'm glad you mentioned this and explained what it says

Content -
* Is tidyverse introduced prior to this episode/lesson? (honest question)

Presentation +
great job being clear and keeping a good pace, recapping was awesome
great intro on the context of dplyr and tidyverse, and their importance in the R community
Spoke and projected very clearly and at a great pace
Good intro of what this lesson is about

Presentation -
I believe the default window arrangement of RStudio has the console in bottom left & environment in top right...assuming learners are using RStudio for first time, might help to match what they will see
Console was a bit small on the top right+1
